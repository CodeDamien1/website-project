    <p class="center"> Well about myself where to start, hi im damien, im currently 27 years old looking over 30, years have not been great to me thats for sure!
        i do see myself as a bit of an introvert i prefer staying in to going out or as my wife says a <q>Hermit</q>. i enjoy playing games a hell of a lot 
        and eventually i would like to work for a games company, i use to do some games developing back when i attended sixthform and i really loved it
        however we didn't really get into much of the coding side of things as i would of liked just mainly the design side as well as certain scripts within game engines
        which brings me to why i wanted to join this course to develop further my skills and go more into the world of tech, which is why i decided to take up this course 
        with <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/" target="_blank">CodeNation</a> </p>  </div>
